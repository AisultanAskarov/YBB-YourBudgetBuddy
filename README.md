# YBB - Budget & Expense Planner

YBB is an iOS budgeting app that I‚Äôve built using SwiftUI and CoreData. It offers a simple, yet intuitive UI without unnecessary features, while having all the essential tools to help users achieve their financial goals. Key features include envelope management, dynamic currencies, advanced analytics, personalized financial advices, and more. As a budgeting enthusiast, I often use apps for quick inputs but prefer to maintain a bigger view of my finances in a separate spreadsheet software like Excel. To accommodate this, I‚Äôve added a feature that allows users to export their financial statements and budgets in CSV format, which can be imported into any spreadsheet software. Future updates will include support for native Excel (.xlsx) format with template layouts.

#### YBB is available [on AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ybb-budget-expense-planner/id6467672552)

## üí° Idea

The idea to develop YBB came to me when as a freelancer I struggled to manage multiple income sources and various bank accounts in different currencies. Living abroad added to the complexity, creating a potential financial disaster in the long run. After trying numerous budgeting apps, I found that those with the features I needed had unintuitive UIs, confusing even an experienced user like me, while simpler apps lacked the necessary tools that I needed to stay on budget. This led me to develop YBB, an app that meets my needs and helps others, while also serving as a valuable addition to my software engineering portfolio.
