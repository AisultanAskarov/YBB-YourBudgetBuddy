# YBB - Budget & Expense Planner

#### YBB is an iOS budgeting app that I've built with SwiftUI and CoreData. The idea of developing a budgeting app came to my mind when I was trying to track my budget as a part-time freelance developer. I have found almost every other budgeting app way too over-complicated and packed with unnecessary features. That's when I decided to create the most straight-to-the-point budgeting app. 

YBB not only lets you budget your expenses in a singular currency but lets you have each budget with its currency and converts all of them to the main currency of the app. This lets you  keep your vocational budgets in local currency while still having an overall picture in your main currency of choice.

#### YBB is available [on AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ybb-budget-expense-planner/id6467672552)
